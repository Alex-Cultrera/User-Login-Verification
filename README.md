# User Login Verification

Project where I used Java to create an application demonstrating a user validation system that reads user information from a file where the credentials are stored, allows users to enter their login credentials, and provides feedback on their login status. The user data is stored in a CSV formatted text file named data.txt.


## Features
- User login verification
